Hi!
I'm Miguel Quaresma, a computer engineer from Portugal interested in
high performance, formally verified, applied cryptography as well as
hardware solutions for systems security such as TEEs.

Currently working towards my Master Thesis named "Runtime verification using
ARM TrustZone".

In my spare I can be found [training triathlon](https://www.strava.com/athletes/4564921/) 
or playing in the mountains, my favorite place.
