      I've been meaning to create my own website for a long time, two years now, but for some reason I kept
      post poning it, not knowing which frontend/backend framework to pick, hopping from one to the other
      as if they were Linux distros. This all stopped when I came to the conclusion that it didn't make any
      sense for me to start developing for the web with a framework when I didn't know the basics of HTML&amp;CSS
      or DOM manipulation.
      <p>
        So here I am, my first post, written in bare HTML with little to no CSS styling, in an
      effort to learn the basics of web development and, hopefully, someday, be worthy of using a framework such as
        React, Angular or Vue.

        Maybe I never will make use of such frameworks, as my focus is more on the low level and security side of
      things, but at least I will have learnt a bit more about HTML&amp;CSS as a whole by forcing myself to
        understand the basics, as they say: <b>"Less is more".</b>
